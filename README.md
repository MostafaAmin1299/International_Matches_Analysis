# International Matches Analysis

Using the dataset  for international matches from 1993 to 2022 to explore them, extract some questions, and try to analyze the data to search for a solution to these questions.

**The questions are:**
- What is the ranking of the best and worst teams based on date, tournament, team continent and the match was in the country or out?
- How many matches over the years and months for each team based on the tournament, the continent team, and the match that was inside or outside the country to find out the preferred time to play for each team?
- What is the level of development of the ranks and points of each team over the years, based on the tournament?
- What is the level of development of the parts of each team (goalkeeper, defense, offense, and midfield) over the years, based on the tournament?
- What are the most countries in which matches are played, based on date, team, tournament, and the match that was inside or outside the country?
